    <p>This recipe is so rewarding to prepare, if you can handle the spice! Start by grinding your meat. Add in the thyme and 
        crushed Fireball peppers. Use this mixture to fill the sausage casings and twist every 6-9 inches. After filling and divinding
        out all the meat you can begin cooking. Gobbledog recommends smoking the glizzys for 12 hours. After they are done cooking, 
        dice your onions and you are ready to go! All you have to do to prepare is stick the sausage in your bread and top with 
        onions. Be sure to keep water nearby and enjoy this classic!
