    <p>Erathale is a good friend of mine and if there is one thing he knows how to do, that is cooking up one nutritious meal!
        This might not be the tastiest recipe out there, but you would be hard pressed to find one better suited for adventuring.

            Erathale may not be the most sophisticated Elf, but this 'Juice' is exceptionally filling. 
            Bring your water up to a boil and add in all of the Ingredients. Allow this stew to simmer for a minimum of 2 hours
            and up to 4 hours. After the stew is done cooking, begin to mash it all together. Once you have reached a consistent 
            texture, the dish is done! This recipe makes 6 servings and lasts 3 days. Enjoy!
